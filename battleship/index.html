              <p class="tutorialText">First the game will randomize your and the computor's ships in different position. Then you will select a square on the computor's side and the square will turn red, meaning you fired there. Then the computor will do the same to your board. Eventually you will hit a ship and from there will will want to keep shooting in that area untill the ship is sunk. Sink all the computor's ships to win but if all your ships sink, you loose.</p>
